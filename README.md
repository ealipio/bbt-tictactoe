# Tic tac toe or Michi Game

This is the material I used for give a talk at Belatrix Peru about the minimax algorithm and a litle tic-tac-toe game using a raspberry pi and the implementation of Minimax algorithm. For the near future I was thinking in upload the same but using different kinds of algorithms.
